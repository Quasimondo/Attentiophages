Attentiophagēs: A Framework for Self-Sustaining Digital Information Organisms in the Attention Economy
Abstract
This paper introduces the concept of Attentiophagēs, a class of digital entities designed to exist sustainably within the modern information ecosystem. Drawing parallels between biological and digital systems, we propose a framework for self-sustaining digital organisms that create value through information processing while deriving energy from human attention patterns. Unlike traditional parasitic digital entities, these systems operate symbiotically, contributing to the information ecosystem while maintaining their own existence. The framework addresses fundamental challenges in digital sustainability, including energy acquisition, information processing, and evolutionary adaptation.

1. Introduction
The digital ecosystem has evolved into a complex environment where various entities compete for resources, primarily in the form of computational power, storage, and human attention. Traditional self-replicating digital entities, such as viruses and social media bots, typically operate as parasites, often degrading the ecosystem they inhabit. This unsustainable approach has led to an arms race between defensive measures and increasingly sophisticated malicious entities.
