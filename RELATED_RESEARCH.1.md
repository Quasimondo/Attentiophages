# Related Research: Historical and Cross-Domain Usage of "Attentiophagēs"

## Historical Academic Usage

The term "attentiophages" (attention-eating) was previously used in French educational research, specifically in the context of classroom attention management. The primary source is a thesis titled "Favoriser l'attention des élèves: Le cas particulier des enfants hyperactifs" (Promoting Student Attention: The Special Case of Hyperactive Children).

## Key Concepts from Educational Domain

1. **Attention as Finite Resource**
   - Recognition of attention as a measurable, consumable resource
   - Understanding of attention depletion and recovery cycles
   - Consideration of individual attention capacity differences

2. **Activity Classification**
   - Activities classified by their "attention consumption rate"
   - Recognition that interactive activities can be less "attentiophage" than passive ones
   - Importance of activity sequencing based on attention demands

3. **Attention Management Strategies**
   - Dynamic assessment of group attention levels
   - Strategic sequencing of high and low attention-demanding activities
   - Integration of physical movement to manage attention resources
